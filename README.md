#Recipe Management application
This is a standalone java application which allows users to manage their favourite recipes. It has a REST API for adding, updating, removing, and fetching recipes. Additionally, users can also filter available recipes based on different criteria as specified in the requirements (vegetarian status, number of servings, specific ingredients, and text search within the instructions).

##Architecutural Decisions

Recipe management application follows MVC Architecture which has the components
Controller Layer, Service Layer, Repository Layer, Model Layer. <br> `RecipeController` class handles Http requests and coordinates the flow of data between the Model and the View. <br> `RecipeService` class represents the service layer. It contains methods for adding, updating, deleting, fetching and filtering recipes. It coordinates with the Repository to perform data access operations. <br> `RecipeRepository` class acts as a Repository layer which handles the data access operations. <br> `Recipe` class represents the data model for a recipe in our application.
